# TranscriptToSummaryChunks-frontend-alpha

This is a testing environment that allows our internal non-tecnical team to interact with our [alpha Summary Transformers](https://github.com/jonathanquaade/transcript-to-summaryChunks-recursive-alpha-v1). This transformer takes a transcript and summarises it. 

For more info on the transfomer, check the transformer repo.
